*Local ecological knowledge of forage plants for goat farming and perceptions about pollination of tree species in the arid Chaco*

Marquez, V., Carbone, L.M., Jimenez-Escobar, D., Britos, H., Aguilar, R., & Zamudio, F.

In this work, we document the goat farming strategies of local peasants, their knowledge about forage plants, and how they perceive pollination of native tree species. Interesting stuff, right? We used semi-structured interviews to gather ethnoecological info and a cognitive approach to learn about the forage plants and their importance. Local peasants shared their insights on the plants they use as fodder. The top forage plants were Neltuma spp., Sarcomphalus mistol, and Castela coccinea, which provide high-quality fruits and leaves at different times of the year. Producers didnâ€™t see pollination as a key factor for forage fruit production but highlighted the importance of climate factors. Understanding this ethnoecological info helps us grasp the peasant management systems that support local communities and play a key role in forest sustainability.
