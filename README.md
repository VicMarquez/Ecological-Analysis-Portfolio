### Local Ecological Knowledge of Forage Plants for Goat Farming and Perceptions about Pollination of Tree Species in the Arid Chaco
Marquez, V., Carbone, L.M., Jimenez-Escobar, D., Britos, H., Aguilar, R., & Zamudio, F.

In this work, I document the goat farming strategies of local peasants, their knowledge about forage plants, and how they perceive pollination of native tree species. Interesting stuff, right? We used semi-structured interviews to gather ethnoecological info and a cognitive approach to learn about the forage plants and their importance. Local peasants shared their insights on the plants they use as fodder. The top forage plants were Neltuma spp., Sarcomphalus mistol, and Castela coccinea, which provide high-quality fruits and leaves at different times of the year. Producers didn’t see pollination as a key factor for forage fruit production but highlighted the importance of climate factors. Understanding this ethnoecological info helps us grasp the peasant management systems that support local communities and play a key role in forest sustainability.

### Multispecies Ethnography Meets Art: Tales of Dogs and Artistic Practices
Marquez, V., Garcia Tàcite, J., Wajner, M., Zamudio, F., &  Medrano, C.

World compositions have always been multispecies. A solely human world is an impossible purification to find. We're just beginning to explore this field of 'emerging studies.' In this context, we present two examples of ethnographies—one in the rural world of the Cordoba Salt Flats, another in an urban neighborhood of the City of Cordoba. This work isn't just about new methodologies for developing multispecies ethnographies but also tackles the challenge of how to write these journeys. We exercised ways to convey the interspecies relationships lived 'in the field' using techniques from artistic practices. This approach helps us dive into the tangled webs of multispecies interactions and reflect on the use of art to communicate these
