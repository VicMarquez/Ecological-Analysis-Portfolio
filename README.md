### Local Ecological Knowledge of Forage Plants for Goat Farming and Perceptions about Pollination of Tree Species in the Arid Chaco
Marquez, V., Carbone, L.M., Jimenez-Escobar, D., Britos, H., Aguilar, R., & Zamudio, F.

In this work, I document the goat farming strategies of local peasants, their knowledge about forage plants, and how they perceive pollination of native tree species. Interesting stuff, right? We used semi-structured interviews to gather ethnoecological info and a cognitive approach to learn about the forage plants and their importance. Local peasants shared their insights on the plants they use as fodder. The top forage plants were Neltuma spp., Sarcomphalus mistol, and Castela coccinea, which provide high-quality fruits and leaves at different times of the year. Producers didn’t see pollination as a key factor for forage fruit production but highlighted the importance of climate factors. Understanding this ethnoecological info helps us grasp the peasant management systems that support local communities and play a key role in forest sustainability.

### Multispecies Ethnography Meets Art: Tales of Dogs and Artistic Practices
Marquez, V., Garcia Tàcite, J., Wajner, M., Zamudio, F., &  Medrano, C.

World compositions have always been multispecies. A solely human world is an impossible purification to find. We're just beginning to explore this field of 'emerging studies.' In this context, we present two examples of ethnographies—one in the rural world of the Cordoba Salt Flats, another in an urban neighborhood of the City of Cordoba. This work isn't just about new methodologies for developing multispecies ethnographies but also tackles the challenge of how to write these journeys. We exercised ways to convey the interspecies relationships lived 'in the field' using techniques from artistic practices. This approach helps us dive into the tangled webs of multispecies interactions and reflect on the use of art to communicate these

### Fire Effects on Pollination and Plant Reproduction: A Quantitative Review
Carbone, L.M., Tavella, J., Marquez, V., Ashworth, L., Pausas, J.G., & Aguilar, R.

In this study, we explore the global impact of fires on plant pollination and reproduction. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to investigate how fire influences pollination and plant reproduction. We examined how these responses differ among pollinators, plant regeneration strategies, vegetation types, and biomes. Our findings reveal that fire enhances the overall production of fruits and seeds, though it doesn't necessarily improve reproduction efficiency. My participation in this meta-analyses triggered my interest in conducting global review and synthesis studies and to deepen into more complex analyses

### Anthropogenic Land-Use Change and Its Impact on Plant Pollination and Fitness
Aguilar, R., Cristóbal-Pérez, E.J., Marquez, V., Carbone, L.M., Paglia, I., Freitas, L., Ashworth, L., Martén-Rodríguez, S., Fernandes, G.W., Lobo, G., Fuchs, E., Quesada, M.

We dive into how human-driven land-use changes are affect pollination and male and female terrestrial flowering plants fitness. As humans occupy most of the Earth's land, it's crucial to understand how these plants reproduce in such environments for their long-term survival and adaptability. We conducted hierarchical and phylogenetically-independent meta-analyses to assess the overall impacts of anthropogenic land-use changes on pollination and plant fitness. We looked at various factors such as habitat loss and fragmentation and their effects on different types of plants and pollinators. Our findings highlight the negative effects of fragmented habitats on plant pollination and fitness, which can reduce recruitment, survival, and long-term viability of plant populations.

### Commoning social–ecological networks through the lens of relational ontologies and other economies: How ecologists can diversify their notions of human–non-human relationships
Astegiano, J., Andrieu, J., 2 ; Wajner, M., Marquez, V., Saur Palmieri, V., Torrico Chalabe, J., Massol, F., Calviño, A., & Zamudio, F.

This publication stems from the dynamic discussions and teamwork fostered during multidisciplinary seminars within the Laboratory of Ecological Interactions and Conservation (of which I am a member). Essentially, we propose theoretical frameworks of relational ontologies and alternative economies as tools to diversify conceptions of nature and culture in socio-ecological systems. Fascinating, right? The main challenge of this work was coordinating and aligning with the numerous researchers involved.

### Pollination and sexual reproduction of key dominant trees of Arid Chaco under different land-use intensities
Marquez, V., Carbone, M.L., Chiapero, L., Calviño, A.L., Ashworth,, A., Zamudio, & Aguilar, R.

In this study, we evaluated the reproductive success and pollination of two key forage tree species in northern Córdoba province (Neltuma spp and S. mistol). Our main findings highlight the importance of conserving forest cover to maintain the pollination services provided by native bees, thereby ensuring the forage production of these species. The biggest challenge of this work was analyzing the vast amount of numerical data we collected for both species. Ecological data is generally complex, with variables of different natures, often over-dispersed, and with random effects in the explanatory models.

### “The cabrero” goat guardian in the arid Chaco
Marquez, V., Wajner, M. & Zamudio, F.

This work is one of my favorites because it was a unique challenge. Unlike other projects, the data here is qualitative and ethnographic, requiring different tools for collection and analysis. We surveyed local practices for raising and selecting livestock guardian dogs in northern Córdoba's farming systems. These dogs are proposed as conservation tools to help mitigate conflicts between wildlife and local producers.

### Silvopastoral and peasant management effects on vegetation and soil quality in the arid chaco of central Argentina
Marquez, V., Carbone, M.L., Chiapero, A.L., Ashworth, L., Calviño, A., Zamudio, & Aguilar, R.

This study aims to evaluate the relative effects on soil quality and plant communities of the two most widespread land uses in the arid Chaco (central Argentina). This comparative study is the first of its kind. The main finding highlights increased soil salinity in areas where forests were cleared and replaced with exotic grasses. This is concerning because soil salinization is a difficult environmental issue to reverse, particularly in arid regions worldwide. Monitoring these processes closely is crucial to ensure sustainable livestock production.

### Frequent fires do not affect sexual expression and reproduction in Vachellia caven.
Marquez, V., Carbone, L. M., Aguilar, R. & Ashworth, L.

This study explores the impact of frequent fires on the sexual expression and reproduction of Vachellia caven. Our findings reveal that V. caven adapts remarkably well to high fire frequency, maintaining its sexual and reproductive functions even in nutrient-poor soils. Despite the repeated challenges posed by fires, V. caven successfully persists and supports viable populations. This research holds a special place in my heart as it was my first paper and the culmination of my undergraduate thesis.
